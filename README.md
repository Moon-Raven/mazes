# Maze Generators and Solver

The project consists of two maze generators and one maze solver. The mazes in this project are generated either using randomized Prim's algorithm, or using depth-first search. Mazes are solved using breath-first search to find the exiting node.

## Prerequisites

The project is developed using python 3. The following python libraries are required:

* numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
* matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)

## Installing and running

The project consists of a single python script which should be executed using python3. The script asks the user to input maze parameters and then generates, solves and displays the maze.
